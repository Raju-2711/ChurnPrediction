# ChurnPrediction


A Data Science Coding Competition project working with a real-world dataset to build a prediction or classification model. Participants used Python and Jupyter Notebook to tackle the problem, focusing on data manipulation, feature engineering, and model evaluation. The competition provided an opportunity for learners to apply their problem-solving and critical thinking skills, as well as gain experience in machine learning algorithms and data visualization techniques.
